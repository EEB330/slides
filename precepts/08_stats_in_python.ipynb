    "1. Assess the homogeneity of variance in the sample datasets\n",
    "2. Determine if the sample data is approximately normally distributed\n",

    "- Sufficient evidence that the assumptions of the t-test have been considered\n",
    "- A t-test p-value and corresponding interpretation of the p-value\n",
    "- Responses to the following questions: What is the difference between a two-sample versus paired t-test? Which `scipy` functions would you use for each?"
