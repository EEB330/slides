# Introduction

In this document, we will explore two significant aspects of data analysis in R: Data Input/Output (IO) and String Wrangling with Regular Expressions (Regex). Data IO is fundamental as itâ€™s the first step in the data analysis pipeline, where we read or load data into R from various sources. String wrangling, particularly using Regex, is vital when we are dealing with text data and need to extract, replace, or modify strings based on specific patterns.

# Data IO in R

Data in R can be read from various sources such as CSV files, Excel files, or databases. Below are some ways to read data into R.

## Using `read.csv` from Base R

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Reading a CSV file using read.csv from base R
data_base_r <- read.csv("places_in_princeton.csv")

# Inspecting the first few rows of the data
head(data_base_r)
```

## Using `read_csv` from `readr`

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("readr")
library(readr)

# Reading a CSV file using read_csv from readr package
data_readr <- read_csv("places_in_princeton.csv")

# Inspecting the first few rows of the data
head(data_readr)
write_delim(data_readr, "places_in_princeton.tsv", delim = "\t")
```

# String Wrangling in R

## A Quick Regex Guide

Regular Expressions (Regex) are a powerful tool to match and manipulate text. Here is a brief guide on some of the basic regex symbols and patterns with examples:

- `\\d`: Matches any digit.
  - Example: `"\\d"` will match any single digit like `5` in `"Price: $5"`.
- `\\w`: Matches any word character (alphanumeric + underscore).
  - Example: `"\\w"` will match any single word character like `a` in `"apple"`.
- `\\b`: Word boundary.
  - Example: `"\\bword\\b"` will match the word `"word"` but not `"swordfish"`.
- `+`: Matches one or more of the preceding character or group.
  - Example: `"\\d+"` will match one or more digits like `123` in `"123 apples"`.
- `*`: Matches zero or more of the preceding character or group.
  - Example: `"a*"` will match any number of consecutive `a`'s, including none, as in `"baaa!"`.
- `(?:)`: Non-capturing group.
  - Example: `"\\d(?:\\.\\d)?"` will match `1` or `1.5` but not `.5`.
- `^`: Start of a line.
  - Example: `"^Start"` will match any line that begins with the word `"Start"`.
- `$`: End of a line.
  - Example: `"end$"` will match any line that ends with the word `"end"`.
- `[]`: Defines a character class.
  - Example: `"[aeiou]"` will match any vowel in `"apple"`.
- `|`: Acts as an OR operator.
  - Example: `"apple|orange"` will match either `"apple"` or `"orange"` in a given text.
- `\\s`: Matches any whitespace character.
  - Example: `"\\s"` will match the space in `"apple orange"`.
- `{n}`: Matches exactly `n` occurrences of the preceding character or group.
  - Example: `"\\d{3}"` will match `123` in `"12345"`.
- `{n,}`: Matches `n` or more occurrences of the preceding character or group.
  - Example: `"\\d{2,}"` will match `123` in `"12345"`, but not `1`.
- `{n,m}`: Matches between `n` and `m` occurrences of the preceding character or group.
  - Example: `"\\d{2,4}"` will match `123` and `12` in `"12345"`.

By understanding and combining these patterns, you can create complex expressions to match a wide range of strings within your text data.

## Installing and loading the stringr package

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("stringr")
library(stringr)
```

## stringr examples


Extracting digits from strings can be crucial to isolate specific numerical information such as prices or zip codes.
```{r, eval=FALSE}
strings <- c("123 Main St", "Price: $200 0")
digits <- str_extract_all(strings, "\\b\\d+\\b")
```

## tidyr examples

Exampled pulled from: [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps#sec-extract-variables](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps#sec-extract-variables)

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("tidyr")
library(tidyr)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df <- tribble(
  ~str,
  "<Sheryl>-F_34",
  "<Kisha>-F_45",
  "<Brandon>-N_33",
  "<Sharon>-F_38",
  "<Penny>-F_58",
  "<Justin>-M_41",
  "<Patricia>-F_84",
)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df |>
  separate_wider_regex(
    str,
    patterns = c(
      "<", # Match the literal character '<'.
      name = "[A-Za-z]+", # Match one or more alphabets (upper or lower case) and create a new column 'name' with the matched value.
      ">-", # Match the literal string '>-'.
      gender = ".", # Match any single character (except newline) and create a new column 'gender' with the matched value.
      "_", # Match the literal character '_'.
      age = "[0-9]+" # Match one or more digits and create a new column 'age' with the matched value.
    )
  )
```

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Reading TSV Files

A TSV file, `places_in_princeton.tsv`, uses a tab character as a delimiter between values. Your task is to read this file into R using an appropriate reading function.
    
## Exercise 2. Regex to English

Explain what this regex patters does: "\\d+[-]\\d+[-]\\d+\\s" in words. What is an example of something it matches?

## Exercise 3: Extracting the parts of an address

With the address column from the data from Exercise 1, we can extract ZIP codes as follows:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
zip_codes <- str_extract(data_tsv_readr$address, "\\b\\d{5}(?:-\\d{4})?\\b")
```

Now, extract the street address from the address string and search each comment for the word "Famous" to determine which locations are famous in Princeton. Follow this up by searching for "historic" Make sure that your search is case-insensitive and captures when historic is a substring as well, like "historical".

## Exercise 4: More string extraction
* Identify locations with a number in their names and extract that number.
* Extract all words starting with 'a' or 'A' from the comment column.

## Exercise 5: Baby names

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("babynames")
library(babynames)
```

To view baby names,
```{r, eval=FALSE}
head(babynames)
```

* What baby name has the most vowels? What name has the highest proportion of vowels? (Hint: what is the denominator?)

## Exercise 6: Extracting month, day, year from the date_strings defined below:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
pak::pkg_install("nycflights13")
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
date_strings <- paste(flights$year, flights$month, flights$day, sep = "-")
```
