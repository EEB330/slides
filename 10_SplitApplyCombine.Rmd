# The apply family of functions

- Meant to make using functions along object easy

- Several types, depending on the input and output type

    - `apply`: along dimensions of an array
    - `lapply`: along the elements of a vector or list, returns a list
    - `sapply`: along the elements of a vector or list, returns a vector (if possible)
    - `tapply`: along the elements of a vector, grouped by a factor vector

- These differ in how the "split" part of Split-Apply-Combine is represented

- These are not always "type stable": the output format can change depending on the function we use

---

# apply in vectors and array

- General strucure: 
```r
apply(X = array or matrix, 
          MARGIN = dimension that is kept, 
          FUN = function that is used)
```

```{r}
data(iris)
# Extract the numeric values as a matrix
iris_num = as.matrix(iris[,1:4])

# calculate colun means
apply(iris_num, 2, mean)

# This is so common there is a fast dedicated function:
colMeans(iris_num)
```

---

# At least one array during this course...

- The `iris3` dataset has the same data as in the `iris` dataframe, but in an array format

- It has 3 dimensions
    - Dim 1, rows, indexed individuals
    - Dim 2, columns, indexes traits
    - Dim 3, that lacks a common name, holds species

```{r}
dim(iris3)
```
--

- To calculate the variance per trait per species

```{r}
apply(iris3, c(2, 3), var)
```
---

# `tapply`, old school `group_by`

- General strucure: 
```r
tapply(X = vector,
          MARGIN = grouping_vector, 
          FUN = function that is used)
```

```{r}
sepal_means = tapply(iris$Petal.Length, iris$Species, mean)
sepal_means
```
--

```{r, eval = F}
# Can be used to calculate residuals from the correct mean
residuals = iris$Petal.Length - sepal_means[iris$Species]
plot(iris$Petal.Length[iris$Species == unique(iris$Species)[1]], ylim = c(-1, 8), pch = 19)
points(iris$Petal.Length[iris$Species == unique(iris$Species)[2]], ylim = c(-1, 8), col = 2, pch = 19)
points(iris$Petal.Length[iris$Species == unique(iris$Species)[3]], ylim = c(-1, 8), col = 3, pch = 19)

for(s in unique(iris$Species)){
  points(residuals[iris$Species == s], ylim = c(-1, 8), col = 4, pch = 18)
}
```

# `lapply`, the super useful generic function for lists


- General strucure: 
```r
lapply(X = vector or list,
           FUN = function that is used)
```

```{r}
# List all the csv files in the current folder
my_csvs = dir(pattern = "\\.csv$")

# Apply the read.csv function to each file
input_dfs = lapply(my_csvs, read.csv)

# Check out the dimensions of the imputed data.frames
lapply(input_dfs, dim)
```

# Modern Alternatives to apply functions

# The evolution of the apply family: `plyr`

- The `plyr` package is an early tidyverse precursor that provides more intuitive replacements for the apply family of functions.

- Functions have a generic naming scheme: `..ply()`

.pull-left[
  - The first letter defines the input format:
    - `l.ply()` - receives a list
    - `d.ply()` - receives a data.frame
    - `a.ply()` - receives an array
] 
--
.pull-right[
  - The second letter defines the output format:
    - `.lply()` - outputs a list
    - `.dply()` - outputs a data.frame
    - `.aply()` - outputs an array
] 
--
```{r}
library(plyr)
adply(iris3, 3, colMeans) # Array to data.frame
```
