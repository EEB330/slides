# Working with Strings

### What are strings again?

- Strings are sequences of charcters
- We use them to represent text

```{r}
string1 <- "This is a string"
string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'
```

If you forget to close a quote, you’ll see +, the continuation prompt:


```r
> "This is a string without a closing quote
+ 
+ 
+ HELP I'M STUCK IN A STRING
```
#"

- Special characters can be "escaped" with a `\`

```{r}
double_quote <- "\"" # or '"'
single_quote <- '\'' # or "'"
```
---

# Other special characters

### New lines and tabs

- `\n` is a new line
- `\t` is a tab
- `\b` is a word boundary

Other unicode characters can be generated using the `\u` or `\U` prefix:

```{r}
x <- c("one\ntwo", "one\ttwo", "\u00b5", "\U0001f604")
x
library(stringr)
str_view(x)
```

---

# Basic string manipulation

.pull-left[
Gluing strings together with the `paste()` function:

```{r}
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "Everyone!"
paste(s1, s2)
```

We can specify the separator with the `sep` argument:

```{r}
paste(s1, s2, sep = ".")
```

Use the `paste0()` function if you don't want any separator: 
#'
```{r}
paste0(s1, s2) # same as paste(s1, s2, sep = "")
```
] 

--

.pull-right[
We can pass vectors to `paste()`

```{r}
s1 = "Hi "
s2 = c("Pol", "Mike", "Carol")
paste0(s1, s2, "!")
```

We can use the `collapse` argument to merge strings in a vector:

```{r}
paste(s2, collapse = "-")
```

]

---

# Find and Replace

### Find

The `grep` funtion can be used to search for a string in a vector:

```{r} 
fruits <- c("apple", "banana", "cherry", "date")

# Find indices of fruits containing 'an'
grep("an", fruits)
```

### Replace 

The `gsub` function can be used to replace part of a string:

```{r}
string2 <- 'If I want to include a "quote" inside a string, I use single quotes'
gsub("quote", "banana", string2)
```

# Regular expressions

.pull-left[
- Think "super advanced find"

- Very useful for data clean-up

- The `stringr` package in R provides functions to work with regular expressions.

- We use a weird syntax to specify the general strucure of the thing we are searching for.
  - This is called a `pattern`

- Slides heavily draw from [https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/regexps)

# Basic matching

.pull-left[
```{r}
library(stringr)
length(fruit)
fruit[1:4]
```
]
.pull-right[

- Let's look for entries that match the pattern: `berry`
#'
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "berry")
```
]

---

# Special characters

- Letters and numbers match exactly and are called **literal characters**. 

- Most punctuation characters, like `.`, `+`, `*`, `[`, `]`, and `?`, have special meanings and are called **metacharacters**. 

- Some common regex metacharacters:
  - `.`: Matches any character.
  - `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences.
  - `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences.
  - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
  - `[ ]`: Character class.
  - `|`: Alternation (OR).
  - `^`: Anchors to the start of the line.
  - `$`: Anchors to the end of the line.

---

# The Wild Card character `.`

Look for the letter `a`, followed by any 3 letters, followed by the letter `e`
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "a...e") 
```

---

# Quantifiers `?`, `+` and `*`

.pull-left[
Quantifiers are metecharacters that can be used to modulate how many matches we are interested in.

  - `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
  - `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences.
  - `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences.


```{r}
string_vec =  c("a", "ab", "abb")
# ab? matches an "a", 
# optionally followed by a "b".
str_view(string_vec, "ab?")
```

]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# ab+ matches an "a", 
# followed by at least one "b".
str_view(string_vec, "ab+")


# ab* matches an "a", 
# followed by any number of "b"s.
str_view(string_vec, "ab*")
```
]

---

# Character classes

Character classes are defined by `[]` and let you match a set of characters

.pull-left[
- `[abcd]` matches `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`
- `[^abc]` any character exept `a`, `b`, `c`

```{r}
str_view(words, "[aeiou]x[aeiou]")
x <- "abcd ABCD 12345 -!@#%."
str_view(x, "[^abcd]+")
```
]
--

.pull-right[
- `-` defines a range, e.g., `[a-z]` matches any lower case letter and `[0-9]` matches any number.
```{r}

str_view(x, "[a-z]+")
str_view(x, "[a-z0-9]+")
```
]
---


# Alternation using `|`

Looking for one of 3 patterns:
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "apple|melon|nut")
```

- Fruits with Double vowels?

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "aa|ee|ii|oo|uu")
```

---

# Anchor characters `^` and `$`

.pull-left[
Fruits that contain with `pl`

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "pl")
```

Fruits that start with `pl`

```{r}
str_view(fruit, "^pl")
```
]

--

.pull-right[
Words that end with `es`
```{r}
str_view(words, "es$")
```

Words that begin with `b` and end with `k`

```{r}
str_view(words, "^b.*k$")
```

]

# Escaping inside regex

.center[
.font200[**Sorry**]
]
.pull-left[
Inside regular expressions, we use the normal escape symbol `\` for several uses

- to search for explicit instances of the metacharacters. Ex: To find the pattern `a.c`
- In order to match a literal `.`, you need an escape which tells the regular expression to match metacharacters literally. 
- So, to match a `.`, you need the regexp `\.` 
- Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and `\` is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression `\.` we need the string  `\\.`
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
# To create the regular expression \., 
# we need to use \\.
dot <- "\\."
# But the expression itself only contains one \
str_view(dot)
# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
str_view(c("abc", "a.c", "bef"), "a\\.c")

```
]

---

# Searching for `\`

If we want to search for `\` it is even worse! 

- To match a literal `\`, you need to escape it, creating the regular expression `\\`. 

- To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape `\`. 

- That means to match a literal `\` you need to write `\\\\` — **you need four backslashes to match one!**

```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
str_view(x)
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```

---

# Why are you doing this to me? This is awful

.center[![](https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/backslashes.png)]

.pull-left[
We can also use literal strings to avoid this mess:
 
- Literal strings are bound by `r"{` ... `}"`

 ```{r}
str_view(x, r"{\\}")
```
]
.pull-right[

- For other metacharacters, we can use character classes:


```{r}
x = c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")
```
]

---

# Common short-cut characters

.pull-left[
There is also a set of special characters that we can use to build our patterns:

- `\d` matches any digit;
- `\D` matches anything that isn’t a digit.
- `\s` matches any whitespace (e.g., space, tab, newline);
- `\S` matches anything that isn’t whitespace.
- `\w` matches any “word” character, i.e. letters and numbers;
- `\W` matches any “non-word” character.
```{r}
x <- "abcd ABCD 12345 -!@#%."
str_view(x, "\\d+")
```
]
--
.pull-right[
.code80[
```{r}
str_view(x, "\\D+")
str_view(x, "\\s+")
str_view(x, "\\S+")
str_view(x, "\\w+")
str_view(x, "\\W+")
```
