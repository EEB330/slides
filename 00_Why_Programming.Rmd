# Modern biology is computational biology

- Biology has become an eminently computational field
- Bioinformatics, statistics, handling large data are now basic tools of biological practice

# Code and analysis sharing

.pull-left[
- Reproducibility

- Reuse

- For academics: 
  - Post-publication peer-review
  - Community can modify and extend an analysis

- Example from us: [github.com/wolfffff/exp_var](https://github.com/wolfffff/exp_var)

# Bespoke Custom Analysis

.pull-left[
- Programming allows you to tailor software for the specific problem you have.

- Sophisticated, custom analysis is more likely solve the exact question you are asking.
  - Canned solutions might solve some other problem that is only related to what you really care about.

- Once a bespoke software solution exists, it can be adapted to other situations, via code sharing or generic packages.

# Why R and/or python?

- Great package ecosystem (CRAN, conda, bioconductor, ...)
- Easy to learn
- Good balance of easy-to-write and fast-to-run code
- Both can easily call code from faster languages if needed

# Effective Visualization 

- Visualization is essential for understanding and communicating data.
- R offers powerful visualization libraries, such as ggplot2.

```{r iris plot, out.height = 300}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, color = Species)) + 
geom_point() + stat_ellipse() + theme_cowplot()
```

# Take home

.pull-left[
- Reproducible research ensures transparency and verifiability.

- R enables bespoke custom analysis and independence in model creation.

- Effective visualization enhances data understanding and communication.

- Sharing analytical tools and leveraging package ecosystems promote collaboration.
