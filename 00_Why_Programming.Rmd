# Why learn programming?

---

# Modern biology is computational biology

- Biology has become an eminently computational field &ndash; as many other fields!
- Bioinformatics, statistics, handling large data sets = now basic tools of biology research and applications

![:scale 90%](figures/foamtree.png)

# Central part of analysis pipeline

&nbsp;&nbsp;

.pull-left[
What does a typical academic research project look like?
- Ideation / research question
- Literature review
- Experiments (field or lab) and **data collection**
- **Data analysis**
- **Plotting results**
- Writing paper, then submitting for publication

Similarly important in industrial projects!

**Need to be "fluent in coding" so that the science part stays at the center**

- Easy to loose track of research goal and hypotheses
- Earlier (excellent) biologists were not trained to treat this big data...  
&rarr; lack of expertise in programming and statistics at this scale  
&rarr; window of opportunity for fresh mindsets

???
Changed in last 10-20 years + researchers are constant learners

# Replication crisis

.pull-left[
Need clean code to share in papers, to ease:
- reproducibility of results
  - "Most published findings are false"   
  &ndash; also p-hacking
- check of **correctness** (peer review)
- post publication, community can:
  - **Reuse** the code (Open Science)
  - Modify and **extend** an analysis

# Excel is very popular

# Coding errors in spreadsheets reach far

.pull-left[
*Growth in the time of Debt*  
Reinhart and Rogoff, 2010, American Economic Review

- Super influential, around 5k citations
- Used to justify economic policy

*Does high public debt consistently stifle economic growth? A critique of Reinhart and Rogoff*  
Thomas Herndon et al., 2014, Cambridge Journal of Economics

# Spreadsheet are not made for data science

**Poor numerical accuracy**

Almiron et al., 2010, Journal of Statistical Software

![:scale 60%](figures/spreadsheet_tests.png)

**Black box functions**  
Poor knowledge/readability of the content of functions used in spreadsheets leads to bad science!

# Bespoke Custom Analysis

.pull-left[
- Custom program for your custom analysis:
  - is more likely to solve *your* exact question
  - does what you designed it for 
- Canned solutions might solve some other problem only *related* to what you really care about.

- Bespoke software solution can then be adapted to other situations via code sharing or generic packages:
  - For you
  - From you

# Why R and/or python?


.pull-left[

- Great package ecosystem  
(CRAN, conda, bioconductor, ...)
- Easy to learn
- Good balance of easy-to-write (and to read)  
and fast-to-run code
- Both can easily call code from faster languages  
(e.g. C++) if needed
- Widely used

# Effective Visualization 

- Visualization is pivotal for understanding and communicating data and results.

.pull-left[
- R offers great visualization libraries, such as ggplot2.

```{r iris plot, out.height = 300}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, color = Species)) +
geom_point() + stat_ellipse() + theme_cowplot()
```
]
.pull-right[
- In Python: matplotlib

# Take home

.pull-left[
- Reproducible research ensures **transparency and verifiability**.

- Coding functions and your model yourself (in R, Python, ...) allows for **tailored analysis + independence and creativity** in methods.

- Effective visualization enhances **data understanding and communication**.

- Sharing analytical tools and leveraging package ecosystems promotes **collaboration (Open Science)**.

# Objectives of the course: teach you to teach yourself

.pull-left[
- Programming ***has to be*** learned by doing, googling, leaving the comfort zone

![:scale 90%](figures/stackoverflow_lost.jpg)

]
.pull-right[

- Goal of the course: **primer in multiple essential tools**, so that you:
  - can code simple programs independently 
  - get the confidence and skills to **navigate the jungle of available resources**
  - can **learn yourself** the code to adress your specific questions in biological science
  - do this faster thanks to shared experience
