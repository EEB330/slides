## Coding errors in spreadsheets are common

## Code and analysis sharing

.pull-left[
- Reproducibility

- Reuse

- For academics: 
  - Post-publication peer-review
  - Community can modify and extend an analysis

## Bespoke Custom Analysis

.pull-left[
- Bespoke custom analysis refers to tailored analyses for specific problems.

- Programming provides a flexible environment for creating custom analyses.

## Why R and/or python?

- Great package ecosystem (CRAN, conda, bioconductor, ...)
- Easy to learn
- Good balance of easy-to-write and fast-to-run code
- Both can easily call code from faster languages if needed

## Effective Visualization 

- Visualization is essential for understanding and communicating data.
- R offers powerful visualization libraries, such as ggplot2.

```{r iris plot, out.height = 300}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Width, Sepal.Length, color = Species)) + 
geom_point() + stat_ellipse() + theme_cowplot()
```

## Conclusion

- Reproducible research ensures transparency and verifiability.
- R enables bespoke custom analysis and independence in model creation.
- Effective visualization enhances data understanding and communication.
- Sharing analytical tools and leveraging package ecosystems promote collaboration.
