# Example: Diversity metrics in ecology

Diversity consists of two components: 

- Species richness : the number of species in a community
- Evenness: some species in a community are common, and others are rare

# Simpson diversity index

.pull-left[

- Related to the Gini inequality index.

- Defined as **the probability that two individuals sampled from the same population will be from the same species.**

  - Given a list of individuals for each species: $\{n_1, n_2, \dots, n_k\}$

  - First we define the proportion of each species: $p_i =  \frac{n_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k n_i}$

  - The Simpson index is given by:

$$
D = \sum_{i=1}^k p_i^2
$$
]

---

# Shannon diversity index

.pull-left[
- Derived from information theory

- Shannon's entropy is the micro-canonical entropy from statistical mechanics.

- Measures the degree of uniformity in the probabilities of observing each species.

  - Again, using the probabilities of observing each species: $p_i =  \frac{n_i}{\sum_{i=1}^k n_i}$

  - The Shannon index is given by:


$$
H = -\sum_{i=1}^k p_i log(p_i)
$$

# Example dataset

```{r}
species_n = c(a = 5, b = 1, c = 10, d = 3, e = 9, 
              f = 10, g = 18, h = 22, i = 8, j = 8)
barplot(species_n)
```

---

# Getting the proportions

.pull-left[
Calculate the total number of individuals

```{r}
n_total = 0
for(i in seq_along(species_n)){
  n_total <- n_total + species_n[i]
}
n_total
```

Calculate the proportion of each species:
```{r}
props = species_n / n_total
round(props, 2) # Only print 2 decimal places
```

# Functions

.pull-left[
- Functions are small(ish) pieces of code that given a set of arguments produce some output

- Functions allow us to repeat the same procedure several times with different inputs without repeating code

- Packages are mostly just groups of related functions

- The help() function shows the help page for any function

```r
help(apply)
?apply
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
f_to_c <- function(f){
  (5/9)*(f-32)
}
f_to_c(60)
```
]

# Good code architecture

- Good code is modular and easy to understand 

- Using functions has several advantages:

  - Modularity: Think about the small steps that compose our solution;

  - Testing: Test each step independently;

  - Maintenance: Easier bug detection and updates;

  - Readability: Clear function names convey intent;

  - Reuse: good generic functions can be used wherever necessary.

- This makes understanding code, finding and fixing problems much easier

# Returning to the Diversity indexes

# Almost everything in R is a function

Inline operators are functions:

```{r}  
`+`(1, 2) # 1 + 2
`==`(2, "a") # 1 == "a"
```

```{r} 
`<-`(a, 1) # a <- 1
a
```

Even the index bracket!
```{r}
x = list(1, 2, "b")
`[[`(x, 3) # x[[3]]
```

---

# Functions as first class objects

Functions can be treated like any other object, so you can:

.pull-left[
- Have a function return another function

```{r}
sum_x <- function(x) {
  f <- function(y) y + x
  f
}
sum_4 = sum_x(4)
sum_4(3)
```

- Make lists of functions:

```{r}
fs = list(mean, median, var)
x = 1:10
c(fs[[1]](x), fs[[2]](x), fs[[3]](x))
```
]
.pull-right[
  - Pass a function as an argument to another function:

```{r}
fogoh <- function(x, f, g, h){
  h_x <- h(x)
  gh_x <- g(h_x)
  fgh_x = f(gh_x)
  return(fgh_x)
}
x = rexp(10)
x
fogoh(x, mean, diff, sort)
```
]
---

# Composing functions

.pull-left[
  - Using intermediate objects:

```{r}
x = rexp(10)
sorted_x = sort(x)
diff_x = diff(sorted_x)
mean(diff_x)
```

- Nesting calls:

```{r}
mean(diff(sort(x)))
```
]

--

.pull-right[
- Using the pipe operator:

```{r}
x |> sort() |> diff() |> mean()

```{r, echo = FALSE}
suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(magrittr))
```
```{r}
# or
library(magrittr)
x %>% sort %>% diff %>% mean
```

# Parts of a function

A function has three parts:

- The `formals()`, the list of arguments that control how you call the function.

- The `body()`, the code inside the function.

- The `environment()`, the data structure that determines how the function finds the values associated with the names.

- Some exceptions are functions that call C code directly: sum, `[`, and a few others

.pull-left[
```{r}
f <- function(x, y) {
  # A comment
  x + y
}

formals(f)
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
body(f)
environment(f)
```
]
---

# Formals

.pull-left[

- Arguments can be called by their name of by their position.

- Argument matching if done first by name, then by position.

```{r}
x = rcauchy(100)
mean(x)
mean(x, trim = 0.1)
mean(x, 0.1)
mean(trim = 0.1, x)
```
]
--
.pull-right[
- Arguments can be separated from the function call:

```{r}
args = list(1, 2) 
do.call(f, args)
```

This `do.call` pattern is useful in some contexts we will see later on. 
]


---

# Default arguments

- In R, functions can have default arguments.

- Default arguments are values that are automatically assigned to a function parameter if no value is provided by the user.

```{r}
# Function with multiple default arguments
calculate_area <- function(length = 1, width = 1) {
  length * width
}

# Call the function
calculate_area()  # Uses both defaults
calculate_area(4)  # Overrides length, uses default width
calculate_area(4, 5)  # Overrides both length and width
```

---

# `...` (dot-dot-dot)

- Special argument that can take any number of additional arguments.

- Usually used to pass along arguments to other functions:

```{r}
f <- function(y, z) {
  list(y = y, z = z)
}

g <- function(x, ...) {
  f(...)
}

g(x = 1, y = 2, z = 3)
```

---

# Environments 

- Environments associate a set of names to a set of values. 
- You can think of an environment as a bag of names

.center[
![:scale 50%](figures/bindings.png)
]

---

# Functions and environments

.pull-left[
- Functions have their own environments, so the same name can be bound to a different value inside the function

- This is called masking

```{r}
x <- 10
y <- 20
g <- function() {
  x <- 1
  y <- 2
  c(x, y)
}
g()
```
]

--

.pull-right[
- If a name isn’t defined inside a function, R looks one level up.
```{r}
x <- 2
g <- function() {
  y <- 1
  c(x, y)
}
g()
```

* And this doesn't change  the previous value of y
```{r}
y
```
]

# Object-oriented programming

- Functions can behave differently depending on the class of the inputs.

- R has a patchwork mess of several object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigms: 

  - S3: (or Simple S) is the oldest and most basic form of OOP in R. It lacks formal class definitions and methods, relying on naming conventions. Objects are typically lists with a class attribute. Methods are defined using functions with the class name in their names, e.g., print, summary.

  - S4: is an improved version of S3, providing more formal class definitions and methods. Classes are defined using the setClass function, which allows more control over object structure. Methods are defined using setMethod and related functions. Strong typing and formal validation of slots (object attributes) can be enforced. S4 supports multiple inheritance.

  - Reference Classes (R5 or RC): R5 classes provide a more traditional OOP experience similar to languages like Java or C#. Classes are defined using the setRefClass function.

  - R6: is an alternative to S3, S4, and reference classes, introduced through the R6 package. It provides a more modern, stateful, and user-friendly OOP experience. Objects are instances of R6 classes, which have methods and private fields. R6 classes are defined using the R6Class function from the R6 package.

# S3 functions

```{r}

```

# Crash-course in S3

Let's make the simplest possible S3 function.

- We need to define 3 functions:
  1. A generic "empty" function with the name we want
  1. A default method code
  2. A method for some class

```{r}
f <- function(x, ...){
  UseMethod("f")
}
f.default <- function(x){
  print(paste("This is the default method. x equals:", x))
}
f.list <- function(x){
  arg = deparse(substitute(x)) 
  print(paste(arg , "is a list."))
}
```
---

# Calling the different methods

```{r} 
num = 17
l1 = list(x = 1)
f(num) 
f(l1)
```
---

# Creating your own methods

You can also add your own methods 

```{r} 
print.my_class <- function(x){
  print("x is a my_class object")
  print.default(num)
}
class(num) <- "my_class"
print(num)
```
---

# Checking the existing methods of a function
