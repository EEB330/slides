# Processing data sets 

---

# Counting along columns

- The most basic processing we can do is counting the number of rows in a column that share the same value 
- Good way to get the unique values in a column (there is also the base function `unique`)

```{r}
flights |> 
  count(carrier)
```

---

# Grouping using `group_by`

- We can also separate our processing using some grouping variable
- All sensible operations happen inside groups in a grouped data.frame
 

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  count(origin)
```

---

# Summarizing values using `summarize`

.pull-left[
- `summarize` can be used to perform operations in the columns

```{r}
flights %>%
  summarise(mean_delay = mean(arr_delay))
```
]
--

.pull-right[
- With `group_by`, this is a powerful function:

```{r}
flights %>%
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarize(delay = mean(arr_delay))
```
]

---

# Combining data sets 

- Sometimes the information we want is split across two data.frames

- Maybe we have two types of measures, or summaries that were calculated separately

- If the columns are all the same, we can just glue them together:

.pull-left[
```{r}
(df_1 = data.frame(x = 1:3, y = rnorm(3)))
(df_2 = data.frame(x = 4:6, y = rnorm(3)))
```
]
--

.pull-right[
```{r}
bind_rows(df_1, df_2) 
```
- For many data.frames, we can put them in a list:
```r
dfs = list(df_1, df_2, df_1) 
bind_rows(dfs)
```
]

---

# Primary and compound keys

A primary key is a variable or set of variables that uniquely identifies each observation.

--

.pull-left[
- `airlines` records two pieces of data about each airline: its carrier code and its full name. You can identify an airline with its two letter carrier code, making `carrier` the primary key.

```{r, echo = F}
library(nycflights13)
airlines |> print(n = 10)
```
]
--

.pull-right[
- `weather` records data about the weather at the origin airports. You can identify each observation by the combination of location and time, making `origin` and `time_hour` the compound primary key.
```{r, echo = F}
library(nycflights13)
nycflights13::weather |> relocate(origin, time_hour) |> print(n = 9)
```
]

---

# Keys and relations across tables

]
---

# Keys for relations between data.frames

- We can use the keys to combine information contained in different data.frames
.pull-left[
```{r}
n_flights = flights %>% 
  count(carrier)
n_flights
```
]
--

.pull-right[

```{r}
airlines
```
]

---

# Using match

```{r}
airline_rows = match(n_flights$carrier, airlines$carrier)
n_flights$name = airlines$name[airline_rows]
n_flights
```

This works well if all the keys in the first data.frame are in the second data.frames
