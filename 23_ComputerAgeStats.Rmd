# Statistical Inference

## What is Statistical Inference?

- Statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations based on sample data.

## Objectives of Statistical Inference

- Primary objectives of statistical inference:

  1. Estimation
  2. Hypothesis Testing
  3. Decision making
  1. Causal inference
  1. Prediction

# What is a Linear Model?

- A linear model is a statistical approach that represents a linear relationship between a dependent variable (Y) and one or more independent variables (X).

.pull-left[
## The linear model equation
  
$y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x + \epsilon$
  
  - y: Dependent variable
  - x: Independent variable
  - β₀: Intercept
  - β₁: Slope
  - $\epsilon$: Error term (residuals)
]
.pull-right[
```r
# Simulate some continuous x and y and 
# fit a linear model
x <- rnorm(100)
y <- 1 + 2*x + rnorm(100)

# Fit model
m1 = lm(y ~ x)
summary(m1)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data.frame(x, y), aes(x, y)) +

# The bootstrap method

.pull-left[
- The Bootstrap Method is a powerful resampling technique used in statistics to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic by repeatedly resampling from the observed data.

- Instead of taking repeated samples from a populations, the bootstrap method attemps to estimate the sampling distribution by using the observed data as a proxy for the true population.

- These samples can be used to estimate standard errors and make hypothesis tests.

# The logic of a permutation test

.pull-left[
1. Determine a statistc of interest
2. Calculate the statistic for the observed data
3. Randomly permute the data
4. Calculate the statistic for the permuted data
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 many times
6. Compare the distribution of permuted statistics to the observed statistic

### Is there a difference in the mean height across locations?
