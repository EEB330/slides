# Precept this week 

- Setting up a proper work environment and git repository.

- Submit one assignment in the course github repository.

- Room TBD

# What it git?

A version control system for any type of file


- Like a track-changes-on-steroids for your life

- A way to store the entire history of changes for a group of files

---

# Why does a programming class use git?

- Everything we do in R is saved in script files

- This code is changed over time and these changes are often lost.

### How to keep older versions of code?

- Option 1: Save a gazillion files named:

> -  script_1.R
> -  script_2.R
> -  script_2_modified.R
> -  script_2_final.R
> -  script_3_finalForReal.R
> -  script_1_again_because_3_was_messed_up.R ...

Or...

- Option 2: <3 Use a version control system <3

# General idea of version control

.pull-left[
* Checkout: the version of the file that is accessible at that moment
]
.pull-right[

]

# How do I get a git to call my own?

* Download:

  * Linux: [http://git-scm.com/download/linux](http://git-scm.com/download/linux)
```bash
$ sudo apt install git
$ sudo yum install git-all
$ sudo pacman -S git
```

  * Mac: [http://git-scm.com/download/mac](http://git-scm.com/download/mac)
  * Windows: [http://git-scm.com/download/win](http://git-scm.com/download/win)

* Make it your own:
```bash
$ git config --global user.name "Diogo Melo"
$ git config --global user.email diogro@gmail.com
```
---

# Commits

![:scale 90%](figures/snapshots.png)

Each commit stores the state of all files in the repository at a given moment

---



# Your day to day in git

![:scale 70%](figures/areas.png)

* Stage: putting changes from a file into a commit
* Commit: putting all staged changes into a commit

---

# The life cycle of a file in git

![:scale 90%](figures/lifecycle.png)

---

# Cool! But how do I do all of this?

1. Create a folder for each project (or use a project in RStudio)
2. Navigate to that folder in the terminal/powershell
3. Type:
```bash
$ git init
```

This will create a git repository inside the folder, and all changes in there will be tracked

---

# Your local day to day

1. Edit a file "script.R" (or several files)
2. In the terminal, add the file to the staging area:
```bash
$ git add script.R
```
3. Check if everything is correct
```bash
$ git status
```
4. Commit that group of changes
```bash
$ git commit
```
   - A text editor will open and ask for a "commit message," which is a description of everything that changed with that commit.
   - Describe what you did VERY accurately, then save the commit file.

```

- We can also see exactly what changed in each version, the difference between two versions, recover old versions...
- Everything that was once committed can be recovered!

# But I want to use github!

# After you've created the repository

```
$ git clone git@github.com:diogro/my_first_repo.git
```

* This will create a folder named my_first_rep with a git repository already initialized.
* We can add more files and keep working, occasionally sending changes to the server.

```
$ git pull (fetches changes from the server)
$ git push (sends changes to the server)
```

# Branches


- Branches: They are "pointers" to specific commits.

- The default is called "master" or "main" but it could be anything.

- Branches allow different versions of files in a repository to coexist, and changes can be shared and "merged."

- If there is more than one copy of a repository (local and server), each one has its own branches.

---

# Creating a branch

![:scale 50%](figures/two-branches.png) 
```
$ git branch testing
```
---

# Picking a branch

HEAD is who you are actually looking at.

![:scale 50%](figures/head-to-master.png) 

---

# Changing the HEAD with a checkout

![:scale 50%](figures/head-to-testing.png) 
```
$ git checkout testing
```
---

# Changing a branch

![:scale 50%](figures/advance-testing.png) 
```
$ vim test.R
$ git commit -a -m 'made a change'
```
---

# Chaning to another branch

![:scale 50%](figures/checkout-master.png) 
```
$ git checkout master
```
---

# Merging two branches

We can bring together modifications made from different starting points by performing a merge!

![:scale 70%](figures/basic-branching-6.png) 

---

# Merge 

![:scale 70%](figures/basic-merging-1.png) 

---

# Merge 

![:scale 70%](figures/basic-merging-2.png)

```
$ git checkout master
$ git merge iss53
``` 

* This will combine the modifications made in commit 4 with those made in commits 3 and 5.

---

# Git local and on a server

* Servers are copies of the repository (forks) with their own branches.

* We can use the same commands locally and remotely, specifying the server.
```
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:diogro/my_first_repo.git
$ git fetch origin master
$ git merge origin/master
```

* Or...
```
$ git init
$ git remote add origin git@github.com:diogro/my_first_repo.git
$ git branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
$ git pull
```
