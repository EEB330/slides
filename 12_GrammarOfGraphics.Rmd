# Grammar or Graphics

.pull-left[
- Weird book...
- Not interested in choosing the correct plot, making the plots pretty, how to make the plots..
- The main idea is to create a general framework to represent plots, instead of having many single use functions

# Normal plots vs GG plots

### Base plots

- Literal description of the graphical elements
- Manual choice of:
  - colors, shapes, legends ...

```{r, eval = FALSE}
n = 60
x = rnorm(n)
z = sample(c(0, 1), n, replace = TRUE)
y = 1 + x + 2 * z + rnorm(n, sd = 0.5)

# Main plot:
plot(x, y, pch = 19)
# The red points:
points(x[z == 1], y[z == 1], 
       col = "tomato3", pch = 19)
# The legend
legend(max(x)-0.5, min(y)+0.5,
       legend = c("z==0", "z==1"), 
       col = c("black", "tomato3"), 
       pch = 19)
```

]
.pull-right[

### GG plots

- Instead of describing the graphical elements, we describe the mapping of variables and graphical concepts

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
df = data.frame(x, y, z = factor(z))
ggplot(df, aes(x, y, color = z)) + 
  geom_point()
```
]

---

# Data

.pull-left[
- Constains the actual information of what is going to be displayed in the plot

- Always assigned to the `data` argument on the ggplot2 `functions`

- Always a data.frame

- Fits well in the tidy data principles

- Requires all the wrangling we saw in the previous lectures
]
.pull-right[
```r
ggplot(data = mpg) + ...

# or

ggplot(mpg) + ...

# or

ggplot() + 
  geom_something(data = mpg)
```
]

---

# Mapping (aesthetics)

.pull-left[
- Allow generic datasets to be understood by the graphic system.

- Aesthetic mapping: Link variables in data to graphical properties in the geometry
  - The mapping argument always receives a call to the `aes` function
  - The arguments in the `aes` function must be assigned to columns in the data
  - This makes the mapping between data and graphical properties

- Facet mapping: Link variables in the data to panels in the facet layout
  - we return to this later

]
.pull-right[
```r
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + ...

# or

ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy)) + ...

# or

ggplot(mpg) + 
  geom_something(aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

# or

ggplot() + 
  geom_something(data = mpg,
                 aes(x = displ, y = hwy))

```

# Scales

.pull-left[
- Most data does not directly represent
graphical properties.
- A scale translate back and forth between
variable ranges and property ranges:
  - Categories → Color, shape, linetype, ...
  - Numbers → Position, color, size, ...
  -  ...

-  Imply a specific interpretation of values:
  - discrete, continuous, etc.
  - if the variable properties are incompatible with the scale, you get an error
]
.pull-right[
```r
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
                     color = year, 
                     shape = drv)) + ...
```

# Geometries


- How to interpret aesthetics as graphical
representations
- Is a progression of positional aesthetics a
number of points, a line, a single polygon,
or something else entirely?
- Mostly determines the plot type.

.pull-left[
**Minimal ggplot**: data, mapping, geometry.
- Everything else has default values
```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(mpg, 
       aes(x = displ, y = hwy, shape = drv)) + 
  geom_point()
```
]
--
.pull-right[
```{r, echo = FALSE,  out.width="75%"}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = mpg, 
       mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy,
                     shape = drv)) + geom_point()
```  
]

# Statistics

.pull-left[
- Even though data is tidy it may not
represent the displayed values
- Transform input variables to displayed
values:
  - Count number of observations in each
category for a bar chart
  - Calculate summary statistics for a
boxplot
- Is implicit in many plot-types but can often
be done prior to plotting
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```
]

---

# Facets

.pull-left[
- Define the number of panels with equal
logic and split data among them…
- Small multiples
- Allows you to look at small subsets of
your data in separate plots
- Panel layout may carry meaning
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(mpg, aes(x = drv, y = hwy)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + facet_wrap(~cyl)
```
