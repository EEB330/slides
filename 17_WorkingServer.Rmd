# Why Use a Remote Server?

.pull-left[
#### 6. Scalability

   - Remote servers are scalable, so you can easily adjust resources based on your needs. This scalability is useful for handling varying workloads.
   
#### 7. Remote Access

   - A remote server allows you to perform tasks on a machine located elsewhere, which can be useful for accessing specific software or environments.

.pull-right[
#### 8. Server Administration

   - If you need to manage servers or perform administrative tasks, remote servers provide direct access to system settings and configurations.
#### 9. Disaster Recovery

   - Remote servers often have robust disaster recovery plans, ensuring minimal downtime and data loss in case of hardware failures or other issues.

# The Terminal

.pull-left[
### What is the Terminal?

- The terminal, also known as the command line interface (CLI), is a text-based interface for interacting with a computer's operating system.
- Unlike a graphical user interface (GUI), where you use a mouse and windows, the terminal relies on text commands.

- MacOS terminal emulator: [https://iterm2.com/](https://iterm2.com/)
- Windows terminal emulator: 
  - [wsl](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
  - [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
  - For using remote servers: [https://www.putty.org/](https://www.putty.org/)

# Understanding Shells

- In the context of the terminal, a **shell** is a command-line interface that interprets and executes commands.
- Shells provide a way to interact with the operating system and run various programs.

#### Bash (Bourne-Again Shell)

- **Bash** is one of the most popular and widely used shells.
- It is the default shell on most Linux distributions and macOS.
- Known for its scripting capabilities, Bash is versatile and user-friendly.

#### Zsh (Z Shell)

Zsh is an extended version of Bash with additional features.
It offers powerful auto-completion, customization options, and theme support.
Zsh is often favored by power users and developers.

#### Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)

[Fish](https://fishshell.com/) is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use, making it an excellent choice for beginners.
It has a unique syntax highlighting feature and interactive auto-suggestions.
Fish emphasizes simplicity and discoverability.

#### Change shells using the `chsh` command

# Configuration Files for Shells

- Shells can be customized by using configuration files.
- These files allow you to define environment variables, aliases, and customize your shell's behavior.


### Bash Configuration: `.bashrc`

- In **Bash**, the `.bashrc` file is used for configuring user-specific settings.
- It is executed whenever you start an interactive Bash session.
- Common configurations include setting aliases, modifying the PATH, and defining shell variables.

#### Example `.bashrc`:
```bash
# Set an alias
alias ll='ls -alh'

# Add a directory to the PATH
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```

# Basic Terminal Operations

#### Creating Files and Directories

- To create a file: `touch filename.txt`
- To create a directory: `mkdir directory_name`

#### Deleting, Moving, and Copying Files

- Deleting a file: `rm filename.txt`
- Moving a file: `mv sourcefile.txt destination/`
- Copying a file: `cp sourcefile.txt destination/`

#### Renaming Files

- To rename a file: `mv oldfilename.txt newfilename.txt`

#### Getting help 

- To get the documentations of a command: `man ls`

---

# Basic Terminal Operations

#### Listing Files in a Directory

- To list files in the current directory: `ls`
- To list files in a specific directory: `ls /path/to/directory`

#### Navigating Directories

- Getting current directory: `pwd`
- Changing to a directory: `cd directory_name`
- Going up one directory: `cd ..`
- Going up two directories: `cd ../..`
- Going to the home directory: `cd ~`
- Going to the last directory: `cd -`

#### Finding Files

- Searching for files: `find /path/to/search -name "filename"`

---

# Interacting with files

#### Getting the contents of a file

- Show the contents of a file: `cat file.txt`
- Stream the content of a large file: `less long_file.txt`

#### Creating and modifying files 

- Directing outputs to files with redirect: `>`
    - `ls -la > list_of_files.txt`

- Repeat the argument: `echo "This is a test"`
  - Echo to new file: `echo "This is a test" > test_1.txt`

- Append to an existing file with `>>`
  - Echo to existing file: `echo "This is a second test" >> test_1.txt`

# The original pipe

- The pipe operator (`|`) is a powerful tool in Unix-like terminal shells.
- It allows you to chain multiple commands together, passing the output of one command as input to the next.
- This enables efficient and flexible data processing.

#### Example: Sorting, Uniqueness, and Word Count

- Let's explore the pipe operator with a practical example.
- We'll use the `sort`, `uniq`, and `wc` commands to demonstrate its functionality.


```bash
ls | sort | uniq | wc -l
```
This command performs the following operations:

1. Lists the files in the current directory
2. Sorts the lines in alphabetical order.
3. Removes duplicate lines.
4. Counts the number of unique lines.

# Using SSH and Remote Servers

#### Logging into a Remote Server

The secure shell protocol (ssh) allows us to connect to the remote server.

Authentication can use a password or the same key-pair we used for github

- To log in using SSH: `ssh username@remote_server_ip`

Setting up key-pair authentication: https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/connect-ssh

#### Copying and Transferring Files

- Copying a file to a remote server: `scp localfile.txt username@remote_server_ip:/path/to/destination/`

#### Remote SSH in vscode

# Job Scheduling Servers

#### What is a Job Scheduling Server?

- A job scheduling server (e.g., Slurm) manages and schedules computing jobs on a cluster of computers.

- https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/support/knowledge-base/slurm

#### Slurm Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=slurm-test    # create a short name for your job
#SBATCH --nodes=1                # node count
#SBATCH --ntasks=1               # total number of tasks across all nodes
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=1        # cpu-cores per task (>1 if multi-threaded tasks)
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4G         # memory per cpu-core (4G is default)
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00          # total run time limit (HH:MM:SS)
#SBATCH --mail-type=begin        # send email when job begins
#SBATCH --mail-type=end          # send email when job ends
#SBATCH --mail-user=<YourNetID>@princeton.edu

module load R
Rscript r_program.R
```

---

# Basic Slurm Commands

- Submitting a job: `sbatch your_script.sh`
- Checking job status: `squeue -u your_username`
- Canceling a job: `scancel job_id`
