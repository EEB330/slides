# Logical operators

- Logical operators are used to perform comparisons in R.
- They return logical values: `TRUE` or `FALSE`.
- Essential for control structures and data filtering.

---

# Single Logical Operators

## Single Comparison Operators

- ">" : Greater than
- "<" : Less than
- ">=" : Greater than or equal to
- "<=" : Less than or equal to
- "==" : Equal to
- "!=" : Not equal to

```{r}
x <- 5
y <- 7
x > y
```

# Comparing Floating-Point Numbers

.pull-left[
1. **Avoid Exact Equality:**

   - Floating-point arithmetic can lead to tiny differences.
   - Instead of `x == y`, use `abs(x - y) < epsilon`.

2. **Specify Tolerance:**

   - Define a small `epsilon` value to handle small differences.

3. **Use Functions:**

   - `all.equal(x, y)` considers small differences.
   - `identical(x, y)` checks for exact equality.

```{r}
x <- 0.1 + 0.2
y <- 0.3
x == y
epsilon <- 1e-10
abs(x - y) < epsilon

# Double Logical Operators

### Single Operators:

.pull-left[
*  **`&` (AND Operator):**

   The single ampersand `&` operator performs element-wise logical AND between two vectors or scalars. It returns a logical vector of the same length as the inputs, where each element corresponds to the logical AND operation of the corresponding elements in the input vectors.

   ```{r}
   x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
   y <- c(TRUE, TRUE, FALSE)
   x & y 
   ```
]
.pull-right[
* **`|` (OR Operator):**

   The single pipe `|` operator performs element-wise logical OR between two vectors or scalars. It returns a logical vector of the same length as the inputs, where each element corresponds to the logical OR operation of the corresponding elements in the input vectors.

   ```{r}
   x <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE)
   y <- c(FALSE, TRUE, FALSE)
   x | y  
   ```
]
---

# Short-circuit evaluation

### Double Operators:

.pull-left[
* **`&&` (Double AND Operator):**

   The double `&&` operator performs short-circuit evaluation. It evaluates the left-hand side expression first and only evaluates the right-hand side expression if the left-hand side is `TRUE`. If the left-hand side is `FALSE`, the operator immediately returns `FALSE`.

   ```{r}
   x <- 5
   x < 10 && z < 6  # z is undefined
   ```
]
.pull-right[
* **`||` (Double OR Operator):**

   The double `||` operator also performs short-circuit evaluation. It evaluates the left-hand side expression first and only evaluates the right-hand side expression if the left-hand side is `FALSE`. If the left-hand side is `TRUE`, the operator immediately returns `TRUE`.

   ```{r}
   x <- 5
   y <- 7
   x > 2 || y > 10  
   ```
]
---

# Single vs double operators

In summary, single operators (`&` and `|`) always evaluate both sides of the expressions, producing vectors of logical results. Double operators (`&&` and `||`) perform short-circuit evaluation, meaning they only evaluate the right-hand side if necessary, and return a single logical value. Double operators are particularly useful when you want to optimize code execution by avoiding unnecessary evaluations.

# if statements 

.pull-left[
## Basic structure

```r
if (condition) true_action
if (condition) true_action else false_action
```


```{r}
grade <- function(x) {
  if (x > 90) {
    "A"
  } else if (x > 80) {
    "B"
  } else if (x > 70) {
    "C"
  } else {
    "F"
  }
}
grade(74); grade(98)
```
]
.pull-right[
## Common errors

```r
if ("x") 1
#> Error in if ("x") 1: 
#  argument is not interpretable as logical
if (logical()) 1
#> Error in if (logical()) 1:
#  argument is of length zero
if (NA) 1
#> Error in if (NA) 1: 
#  missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed
if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1
#> Warning in if (c(TRUE, FALSE)) 1: 
#> the condition has length > 1 and only the
#> first element will be used
## [1] 1
```
]

# Vectorized if

### The ifelse function

```r
ifelse(logical_vector, true_action, false_action)
```

```{r}
x <- 1:10
x %% 2
x %% 2 == 0
ifelse(x %% 2 == 0, "even", "odd")
```

---

# Loops

.pull-left[
### Basic structure

```r
for (item in vector) perform_action
```

```{r}
for (i in 1:3) {
  print(i)
}
```
]

---

# Structure of a useful loop

.pull-left[

- Usually we want to keep the results of a calculation stored in a new vector

- It's always a good idea to allocate this vector before the loop and use each iteration to set its elements.

```r
n <- 10 # lenght of results        
results_vec <- numeric(n), list(n), character(n)
for(i in 1:n){
    results_vec[i] <- work_function(vector[i])
}
```
]
.pull-right[
```{r}
n <- 5
grades <- floor(runif(n, 70, 100))
grades
letter_grades = character(n)
for(g in 1:n){
    letter_grades[g] <- grade(grades[g])
}
letter_grades
```
]

---

# Common mistakes

### Failure to index the `results` object

.pull-left[
```{r}
n <- 5
grades
letter_grades = character(n)
for(g in 1:n){
    letter_grades[g] <- grade(grades[g])
}
letter_grades
```
]

.pull-right[


```{r}
n <- 5
grades
letter_grades = character(n)
for(g in 1:n){
    letter_grades <- grade(grades[g]) #<<
}
letter_grades
```
]

---

# Common mistakes
 
### The `1:lenght(x)` pattern

.pull-left[
```{r}
means <- c(1, 50, 20)
out <- vector("list", length(means))
for (i in 1:length(means)) {
  out[[i]] <- rnorm(5, means[[i]])
}
out
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r, eval=FALSE}
means <- c() #<<
out <- vector("list", length(means))
for (i in 1:length(means)) {
  out[[i]] <- rnorm(10, means[[i]])
}
#> Error in rnorm(10, means[[i]]): invalid arguments
```

```{r}
means <- c()
1:length(means)
```
]
